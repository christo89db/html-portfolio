<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  My name is Christopher. I'm an aspiring Web Developer/Programmer currently based out of Alberta, Canada. Having diving into the world of Web Development late 2023, I'm excited to progress and learn more going into 2024 and beyond.

<p>Aside from Web Development and programming, I'm also a proffessional photographer and videographer. I love anything that is creative that requires and abstract approach to achieving a desirable finished product and that's what has drawn me into the world of Development. </p>
